# How It Works
- once device is configured in user environement, the device will send data periodically to backend
- backend will store data recieved from devices and provide a way to secure writing data into database using user authentication using SMS OTP
- frontend will display data stored in backend for mobile ( Android / IOS ) and Web

## Device
we managed to create two devices one based on ESP8266 for low cost, and other based on ESP32 for maximum features
- [ESP32](https://github.com/salim97/University-Graduation-Project-Air-Quality-System/tree/master/ESP32%20Air%20Quality)
- [ESP8266](https://github.com/salim97/University-Graduation-Project-Air-Quality-System/tree/master/ESP8266%20Air%20Quality)

## Backend
we chosse firebase for [free plan offer](https://firebase.google.com/pricing), and since it's a serverless approach that mean it's durable and flexible
- [Firebase](https://github.com/salim97/University-Graduation-Project-Air-Quality-System/tree/master/Firebase)

## Frontend
we chosse flutter for cross platfrom user expirance mobile and web
