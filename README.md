# How It Works
- once device is configured in user environement, the device will send data periodically to backend

## Device
we managed to create two devices one based on ESP8266 for low cost, and other based on ESP32 for maximum features

- [ESP8266](https://github.com/salim97/University-Graduation-Project-Air-Quality-System/tree/master/ESP8266%20Air%20Quality)

## Backend
we chosse firebase for [free plan offer](https://firebase.google.com/pricing), and since it's a serverless approach that mean it's durable and flexible
